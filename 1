### 🪦 Variable Crimes
```python
x=1;y=2;z=[3,4,5];A='hi'
```
Oh wow, so you gave Python *semicolons*, because it wasn’t cursed enough already. This isn’t stylish; this is cosplay as JavaScript on meth.  
And `A = 'hi'` — set once, used never. That variable is the **NPC of your codebase.** Just chilling there, contributing nothing, like that one coworker who “manages synergy” but actually eats donuts all day.  

---

### ☠️ Function `f` — aka Chaos in Four Dimensions
```python
def f(a,b=0,c=1,*args,**kwargs): global x;global y;
```
Nothing says *I hate maintainability* like nuking local scope on sight. Why even bother with parameters if you’re just going to hijack global variables like a bandit in a Wild West movie?  
The `global` keyword should honestly call your parents and ask what went wrong.  

```python
if a==42:return str(a)+" is THE answer!!!"
```
This doesn’t make you quirky. This makes you a dad joke in code form. The code equivalent of wearing socks with sandals.  

```python
while a<15:
    a+=1
    if a==13:break
```
Bahahaha. Your loop is literally scared of the number 13. What is this, **superstitious Python**? Did your codebase get hexed by a witch? This isn’t iteration, this is numerology.  

---

### 🛑 Function `g` — “Oops: The Function”
```python
else:r.append(math.sin(i)**2 + math.cos(i)**2 -1)
```
This. Right here. You wrote **Pythagoras cosplay fanfiction.** An identity that's guaranteed to be zero, wasting CPU cycles *just to show off that you know sine and cosine exist*. You basically `import math` just to gaslight people.  

```python
if i%5==0:r.append("oops")
```
Imagine building a data generator that randomly screams **“oops”** like a dying fax machine. This isn’t output — this is a *cry for psychiatric help.*  

---

### 🧟 The Class `H`
```python
def add(self,v): self.data.append(v if v!=None else "None")
```
Why handle `None` properly when you can just replace it with the literal string `"None"`? This is **data corruption with extra steps.** Somewhere, Guido van Rossum just puked in his sandals.  

```python
def __str__(self):return str(self.data)+" some random stuff "+str(x*y)
```
Oh yeah, blend unrelated globals into your object string. Because when I print an object, I TOTALLY WANT random math multiplications in there. This isn’t `__str__`. This is ransom note output from an object that has seen things.  

---

### 🧨 The `main` Dumpster Fire
```python
a=f(11,c=2)+f(42)
```
This line *alone* is proof you have no idea what your own functions do. Adding them together like Pokémon cards? What’s next, string concatenation with sorting algorithms?  

```python
for i in range(len(lst)):dct[str(i)]=lst[i]
```
Yes. Use `range(len(x))`. Because Python’s `enumerate` is for nerds, right? This line could be cleaner, but nahhh, let’s keep carrying C-style baggage through Python like a divorced dad clinging to his mixtape.  

```python
try:
    print(100/((x-y)%(z[1]-y)))
except:
    print("lol error")
```
Ladies and gentlemen, behold: the crown jewel of this abyss. A deliberate **divide-by-zero landmine**, wrapped in the least helpful exception handler of all time.  
Any real bug? Any runtime catastrophe? Nah. Your program just shrugs and mutters **“lol error.”** Can you imagine NASA running this? “Oops, the Mars rover fell into a crater. lol error.”  

---

## 💀 Obliteration Verdict
Your program is not just bad code.  
It is:  
- A **seminar in poor design choices.**  
- A **sacrificial ritual** where readability was offered to Satan.  
- The **physical embodiment of Stack Overflow answers copy-pasted without actually reading them.**  
- A **how-to guide for getting fired from Google in under 30 minutes.**  

This code doesn’t just fail style guides — it actively sets them on fire and then sues them for **emotional damages.**

---

⚰️🔥 Final Word:  
If this code were a building, it wouldn’t pass inspection. Not for safety. Not for aesthetics. Not even for *existence*. The only thing it’s structurally sound enough to house is a colony of raccoons.
