# :bell: **Roblox Release Notes — Version 7.13.99 “Tectonic Tremors Update”**  

---

:wave: Hello Developers!  

After extensive “feedback” (read: *3,000 bug reports and mild lawsuits*), we’ve decided to intervene on the rising misuse of community‑created code such as your so‑called **ScreenShakeModule.lua**, which has been classified by FEMA as a Category 5 hazard.  

---

## :rotating_light: **New Policies & Fixes**  

1. **UI Shaking Now Registered as a Seismic Event**  
   - Any GUI shaking over **5 pixels in magnitude** now triggers an **Earthquake Warning** across all Roblox clients in real time.  
   - Your `ScreenShake:ShakeGUI()` method no longer shakes the UI — it instead calls **USGS.gov** to notify them of an “anomalous tectonic event.”  

---

2. **RenderStepped Abuse Ban**  
   - Developers caught attaching RenderStepped to violent GUI jitter will now be **IP banned** from local seismograph stations.  
   - In-game, your GUI will automatically post in chat:  
> *“I didn’t consent to this earthquake.”*  

---

3. **Player Safety Features**  
   - Users with motion sickness are now automatically given a **UI helmet** and a high‑visibility jacket before entering games with ScreenShake.  
   - If a player ALT+F4’s within 2 seconds of shake start, Roblox will auto‑refill their glass of water IRL.  

---

4. **Insurance Coverage**  
   - Due to rising screen repair claims, Roblox will now include **Earthquake Insurance™** as part of Roblox Premium.  
   - *Note:* Deductible applies if your “Idle Snooze” animation triggers **UI Shake Seizure Level 99.**  

---

## :warning: **Known Issues**  
- Some developers still insist their violently shaking health bars are “immersive.” These developers are now confirmed on a government watchlist.  
- ScreenShakeModule fans have formed a cult, chanting “offsetX, offsetY” in perfect sync.

Thanks for reading today’s **Patch Notes**! Please remember:  
✔ Shake your milk, NOT your UI.  
✔ Magnitude `50` ~= Natural Disaster.  
✔ Roblox GUIs are for menus, **not tectonic roleplay.**  

Stay safe, Devs.
